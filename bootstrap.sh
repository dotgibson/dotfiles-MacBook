# BREW — which brew binary provision() drives. The BOOTSTRAP_BREW override exists so the
# provision path is TESTABLE at all: a stub earlier on PATH cannot shadow the real brew,
# because brew_shellenv's `path_helper` puts /opt/homebrew/bin at the FRONT of PATH before
# provision() ever runs. Every provision call site goes through this — INCLUDING the
# `command -v` gates, so a test with a stub can never fall into the real Homebrew
# installer. brew_shellenv deliberately keeps its own hardcoded absolute prefixes: its job
# is to FIND Homebrew, which is exactly what an override must not fake.

# PRE_COMMIT — which pre-commit binary installs the repo's local commit-time hook. Same
# seam, same reasoning as BREW above. This one is unavoidable rather than merely
# convenient: the hook goes into $REPO, and $REPO is derived from this script's own
# location, so unlike $HOME it CANNOT be pointed at a sandbox. Without the override,
# test/test-repo.sh's full-run case would rewrite the contributor's own
# .git/hooks/pre-commit as a side effect of running the tests — and since `make test-repo`
# is itself one of the pre-commit hooks, that means rewriting the hook mid-commit. Aimed
# at a stub the install path still runs and is still asserted on; it just does not touch git.

# MISE — which mise binary runs `mise install`. Same seam, same reasoning as BREW: the step
# runs AFTER brew_shellenv has put /opt/homebrew/bin at the front of PATH, so a PATH stub
# loses to a real Homebrew mise. test/test-repo.sh's full and --no-brew runs then drove a
# REAL `mise install` of every pinned runtime inside the throwaway HOME, against the

bootstrap.sh — idempotent macOS provision + symlink wiring. Safe to re-run.

  ./bootstrap.sh                  full: Homebrew + brew bundle + symlinks
  ./bootstrap.sh --links-only     just (re)create symlinks, no installs
  ./bootstrap.sh --no-brew        symlinks + mise, skip Homebrew/brew bundle
  ./bootstrap.sh --macos-defaults also run macos/defaults.sh (system prefs)
  ./bootstrap.sh --set-shell      make Homebrew zsh the login shell (chsh)
  ./bootstrap.sh --only zsh,nvim  link ONLY these module groups (zsh nvim tmux git prompt tools desktop)
  ./bootstrap.sh --skip desktop   link everything EXCEPT these module groups
  ./bootstrap.sh --uninstall      remove Core symlinks + restore backed-up files
  ./bootstrap.sh --dry-run, -n    print every planned action; change nothing
  ./bootstrap.sh --quiet, -q      show only CHANGES + the summary (quiet re-runs)
  ./bootstrap.sh --json           emit a machine-readable summary on stdout (for automation)
  ./bootstrap.sh -h, --help       show this help

Flags combine: `./bootstrap.sh --links-only --dry-run` previews the symlink
plan without touching your home directory. `--quiet` suppresses section headers
and the per-file "already linked" lines, so a re-run prints only what actually
changed — handy once you're set up and just re-syncing. `--uninstall --dry-run`
previews exactly what an uninstall would remove and restore, changing nothing.

Exit codes:
    0  clean run
    1  could not run (not macOS, missing core/, no Command Line Tools)
    2  usage error (unknown flag, bad --only/--skip selector)
    3  ran, but one or more steps FAILED — the box is degraded; see the summary
       (under --uninstall: a dest would not unlink, so it is still wired to the repo)
  130  interrupted (Ctrl-C); bootstrap is idempotent, just re-run

# `|| info "…"` and then FORGOTTEN: the run still closed with "bootstrap complete" and
# exit 0, leaving a box that got none of its runtimes indistinguishable from a good one,
# to the operator and to anything parsing --json alike. Two channels are the record.
#
# ERROR   = a step that was supposed to do something and didn't (mise, defaults.sh,
#           chsh, tpm). Non-empty ⇒ the closing line says so and we exit 3.
# WARNING = a notice that does NOT make the run degraded (a tool not on PATH *yet*
#           because you need a new shell). Never affects the exit code.
#
# The ERROR channel is Core's: fail_note is a shim over blib_note_fail, which records
# into the lib's BLIB_FAILED and warns on stderr as it happens, and the closing tally
# comes from blib_failures_report (dotfiles-core#973). That is the same array the shared
# scaffold records its OWN failures into (a tpm clone behind a proxy), so there is no
# longer a fold from one ledger into the other, and no reset that could drop a miss
# recorded before the wiring step. The lib models failures only — there is no warnings
# channel — so WARNINGS stays this file's own.

#
#   1. UNCONDITIONALLY, right after the guards below — provision() is the only thing that
#      used to run it, and --links-only skips provision() entirely. From a fresh /bin/bash
#      (the first Terminal on a new machine, or CI) /opt/homebrew/bin isn't on PATH yet, so
#      `command -v mise` further down failed and the whole `mise install` step silently
#      no-op'd with no message — a green "bootstrap complete" and no runtimes.
#   2. Again inside provision() after a FRESH Homebrew install, when call (1) ran before
#      brew existed and therefore found nothing.
#
# Idempotent and safe to call twice: `typeset -U`-style dedup isn't available in bash, but
# `brew shellenv` emits absolute assignments, so the second call just rewrites the same
# values.
#
# CAPTURE-then-CHECK-then-eval, never `eval "$(brew shellenv)"` directly: a non-zero
# shellenv (corrupt install, unreadable prefix, a brew whose Ruby is broken) expands to an
# EMPTY string, and `eval ""` exits 0 — so `set -e` never fires and PATH is silently never
# set. That is the identical failure shape this commit series removes from the Homebrew
# installer one-liner, and it matters MORE here now that the early call is the only thing
# putting brew on PATH in --links-only mode.
#
# What is checked is the EXIT STATUS and then the resulting PATH — never the shape of the
# output. Empty output is a documented SUCCESS (see the guard note in the body).
#
# Returns non-zero (after saying so) when a brew binary exists but shellenv fails, so a
# caller that genuinely needs brew can escalate. Not fatal on its own — the symlink-only
# modes work fine without Homebrew, so a broken brew must not stop them. A box with no

# of the seven plugins tmux.conf declares (#135). tpm ships a headless entry point, so
# bootstrap can simply do it.
#
# It CANNOT be called bare, and getting this wrong is silent. tpm resolves its install
# directory from the TMUX_PLUGIN_MANAGER_PATH set on a tmux SERVER; core/tmux/tmux.conf
# only ever sets that asynchronously, from its trailing `run '…/tpm/tpm'`. Reach tpm before
# that fires and the value is empty, tpm does `cd "/"`, and every clone fails. `-f
# /dev/null` is not a way out either: the @plugin LIST is read off the same config, so a
# config-less server installs nothing at all.
#
# So: start a THROWAWAY server on a private socket (TMUX_TMPDIR), load the real config on
# it so the @plugin list is present, and set the path explicitly. The operator's own tmux —
# quite possibly the one they are running this from — is never touched, and the throwaway
# server is killed on the way out.
#
# XDG_CONFIG_HOME is pinned for the same reason, and it is not paranoia: tpm derives its
# own path from `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}/tmux` and re-sets it on the server as
# the config loads, LATER than — and therefore over the top of — the set-environment below.
