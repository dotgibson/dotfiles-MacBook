# test/test-repo.sh — behavioral regression harness for THIS repo's own code.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `make test` runs the VENDORED Core harness (core/scripts/test-core.sh). That never
# touches the repo-owned surface: bootstrap.sh (symlink/backup/seed/dry-run/arg-parse),
# the zsh loader in zsh/zshrc, the macOS interactive layer, or macos/defaults.sh. Those
# are the highest-risk, hardest-to-reverse scripts here and were previously gated only
# by `bash -n`/`zsh -n` (syntax, not behaviour). This harness closes that gap.
#
# It is HERMETIC and runs anywhere (Linux CI included): bootstrap.sh is macOS-only, so
# we set BOOTSTRAP_ALLOW_NON_DARWIN=1. Every mutation is sandboxed under a temp HOME, and
# zsh-dependent checks self-skip when zsh is absent (matching test-core.sh's contract).
#
# PROVISION IS EXERCISED HERE, and this file is where that fact lives (#178). Sections
# B1b3/B1b4 run a FULL bootstrap — no --links-only — so provision() actually executes.
# They reach it only through the BOOTSTRAP_BREW seam and a PATH shim dir, never the real
# Homebrew, and they self-skip where the Command Line Tools are absent (so Linux CI runs
# everything except them). The macOS CI leg sets REPO_TESTS_GATE_PROVISION=1 and section
# G2 turns "they all skipped" into a FAILURE there — this repo's provision() gate is that
# leg, and Core's reusable bootstrap-test.yml cannot be it.
#
# HONEST LIMIT, so a green run is not over-read: these sections prove provision() RAN,
# BRANCHED, and returned/exited as designed. Nothing is installed. They say nothing about
# whether the Brewfile's formulae exist, whether a cask name is right, or whether a real
# Homebrew install would succeed — only `make brew-check` on a provisioned machine, or a
# periodic real bootstrap, covers that.
#
# HOW MANY ASSERTIONS: it depends on the box, which is why README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
# quote "~150" rather than a figure. Whole sections self-skip where they cannot run — the
# provision cases need the Command Line Tools, the zsh ones need zsh — so the same tree
# reports 109 pass / 4 skip on Linux CI and 151 pass / 0 skip on the macOS runner (a
# contributor's Mac lands elsewhere again — an already-present pre-commit hook skips one).
# There is no single true number, and the exact one those docs used to carry (48) was
# stale by more than half before anyone noticed. Do not put a precise count back.

# ── B1b4. bootstrap.sh: provision()'s Homebrew-installer branches (#178) ──────
# B1b3 above covers a brew BINARY THAT EXISTS AND CRASHES. That means `command -v "$BREW"`
# SUCCEEDS, so the entire installer block (bootstrap.sh:677-702) — the only code in this
# repo that downloads and then EXECUTES a script — is skipped, along with the satisfied-
# Brewfile fast path and the --no-brew gate. One of provision()'s ~11 branches was gated;
# these cases take the rest. Pointing BOOTSTRAP_BREW at a path that does NOT exist is what
# flips `command -v` and makes the installer block reachable at all.
#
# SAFETY, and it is why this section is shaped the way it is: inside that block the run
# really invokes curl and really runs whatever came back. TWO INDEPENDENT layers stop that
# from ever being the real Homebrew installer on a contributor's Mac:
#   1. a `curl` shim first on PATH — proven per-run by shim_wins(), not assumed;
#   2. an unroutable proxy in the environment of EVERY run below (prov_run), so even a shim
#      that somehow lost the PATH race gets a curl that fails in milliseconds having
#      touched no network. The worst case is then a case landing in the download-failure
#      branch and failing its OWN assertion loudly — never a real install.
#
# WHY A PATH SHIM WORKS HERE WHEN B1b3 NEEDED THE BOOTSTRAP_BREW SEAM. brew_shellenv evals
# `brew shellenv`, which on macOS re-runs path_helper and REWRITES PATH: it hoists
# /opt/homebrew/{bin,sbin} to the front but PRESERVES the relative order of everything
# else, so a prepended shim dir stays ahead of /usr/bin. A `brew` stub still loses, because
# Homebrew links a real `brew` into the dir that just got hoisted above it — hence the env
# seam. Homebrew links no curl (keg-only, :provided_by_macos), no mktemp (it ships gmktemp)
# and no xcode-select, so those stubs survive. That is a property of today's Homebrew, not
# a law, so PROVE it with the same mechanism bootstrap.sh uses and skip rather than run
# blind if it ever stops holding.

# config lands in blib_link_core, every repo picks the LINK up automatically from the

# silent: --uninstall reports success and leaves a dangling symlink.

# checks the two helpers THIS repo calls (blib_link_core, blib_link_os_layer); the
# role-layer helper is not called here.
