# test/verify-core.sh — assert the vendored core/ subtree is BYTE-FOR-BYTE the upstream
# dotfiles-core commit it was vendored from.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# WHY THIS EXISTS: core/scripts/audit-core.sh proves the vendored tree is internally
# consistent, but it canNOT prove it equals upstream — its manifest lists some entries at
# DIRECTORY granularity (e.g. `tmux/scripts/`), so a file ADDED or a tracked file EDITED
# inside such a dir passes the audit while silently diverging from Core. Two real drifts of
# exactly that shape were found here: an orphaned tmux-sessionizer.sh (added, removed
# upstream) and an in-place edit of mise/config.toml. This is the backstop: diff the
# vendored core/ against upstream AT THE RECORDED SUBTREE-SPLIT COMMIT, so ANY difference is
# a genuine local modification — a `git subtree pull` conflict or a hand-edit — not just
# "we're behind upstream" (which comparing against HEAD would noisily flag).
#
# Best-effort + graceful, like the other gates: when upstream is unreachable (offline, a
# restricted runner) or no subtree marker exists, it SKIPS (exit 0) rather than failing —
# it can only verify what it can fetch. Override the upstream with CORE_UPSTREAM (a git URL
# or a local path); the default is the public dotfiles-core.
#
#   ./test/verify-core.sh                              # verify against the public upstream
#   CORE_UPSTREAM=/path/to/dotfiles-core ./test/verify-core.sh   # verify against a local clone
