# dotfiles-MacBook/os/macos.zsh  →  ~/.config/zsh/80-os.zsh  (v4: numbered OS-layer fragment)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# macOS-only INTERACTIVE shell extras. Sourced near the end of .zshrc (after the
# Core modules), so it can override Core. PATH/env that must exist in every shell
# lives in .zprofile/.zshenv, not here. Nothing offensive here — that's dotfiles-Offense.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Native clipboard already works: Core's `clip`/`clip-paste` detect Darwin and
# shell out to pbcopy/pbpaste, so no aliases are needed here.

# The direnv hook and the gh/uv/ty completions are Core's: core/zsh/00-tools.zsh runs
# `direnv hook zsh` through _cache_eval and generates the three completion files into
# fpath before compinit (dotfiles-core#449, #579). This layer cached all four itself, plus a
# bare-eval fallback, until the fleet's owned-block gate caught the copy (dotfiles-core#966).
# Re-adding them here would double the hook registration and shadow Core's completions.

# ── where this repo lives (DERIVED, never hardcoded) ─────────────────────────
# %x = the path of THIS sourced file, :A follows the bootstrap symlink back to
# <repo>/os/macos.zsh, :h:h climbs to the repo root. The same technique Core's
# 10-options.zsh uses, and the one this file already relied on for its completions dir.
#
# It is derived rather than written down because the clone location is the operator's
# choice: the README says ~/dotfiles-MacBook, but a real checkout of this very repo lives
# at ~/code/dotgibson/dotfiles-MacBook, where every hardcoded "$HOME/dotfiles-MacBook"
# silently pointed at a directory that does not exist. `.zprofile` sets this too (login
# shells need it before .zshrc runs); `:=` means whichever runs first wins and the other
# is a no-op, and a non-login interactive shell still gets it here.

# ── repo-owned completions (bootstrap.sh) ─────────────────────────────────────
# Core adds its completions dir to fpath BEFORE compinit (10-options.zsh), so compinit
# auto-registers them. This macOS layer loads AFTER compinit, so add the repo's
# completions dir to fpath and then explicitly autoload + compdef — compinit won't
# re-scan fpath on its own.
