# Changelog

All notable changes to **dotfiles-core** are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Core is the single source of truth vendored into nine OS repos via
`git subtree pull --prefix=core <core-remote> main --squash` (see `scripts/sync-core.sh`).
Every entry below is therefore a change those repos receive on their next sync —
this file is the human-readable record of _what_ a sync will bring, complementing
the SHA that `scripts/sync-core.sh` now prints. To cut a release, move the
`[Unreleased]` items under a new `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading and tag the
commit (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m vX.Y.Z`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `core.version` — a human-readable SemVer stamp vendored into every OS repo, plus a
  `core-version` verb that reads it, so you can tell WHICH Core a given OS repo carries
  from inside it (the subtree squash records the commit; this records the version).
  `scripts/sync-core.sh` prints it on fan-out and the audit asserts it is well-formed.
- `core-doctor` — the shell counterpart to nvim's `:checkhealth gerrrt`: a scannable
  report of which modern-CLI tools Core detected on this box and which integrations are
  live, including the RESOLVED binary names (`fd`/`fdfind`, `bat`/`batcat`) and the
  detected package manager. Read-only.
- `up -n`/`--dry-run` — list the packages that WOULD upgrade and exit, touching nothing
  (the non-destructive inspect the count-only nudge didn't offer).
- `make audit-changed` (`audit-core.sh --changed`) — scope the audit to what your local
  git diff touches, via the SAME `scripts/ci-classify.sh` CI uses; fails safe to the
  full run when the diff can't be resolved.
- First-party completions for `fif`, `fbr`, `core-version`, and `core-doctor`, and a
  `core.version`/`up --dry-run`-aware `_up`; the completion-parity test now covers them.
- `.shellcheckrc` — repo-wide ShellCheck config (`external-sources`, `source-path`,
  `shell=bash`) so author-time, CI, and editor lint identically.
- `zsh/ui.zsh` — shared terminal-UX primitives (`_core_err`/`_core_warn`/`_core_ok`/
  `_core_hint`/`_core_usage`/`_core_confirm`/`_core_spin`), gum-aware with a plain
  fallback on every helper. Loads right after `tools` in the canonical chain and is
  adopted across `functions.zsh`, `op.zsh`, `update.zsh`, and `plugins.zsh`, replacing
  ad-hoc `echo "Usage: …"` lines with one consistent voice (colour only on a TTY,
  `NO_COLOR` honoured, diagnostics to stderr).
- `core-help` (alias `cheat`): a grouped, column-aligned cheat sheet of Core's
  functions, keybindings, and maintenance verbs — the shell counterpart to which-key.
  Plus a once-per-machine first-run hint pointing at it (`CORE_WELCOME=0` to silence).
- First-party zsh completions (`zsh/completions/`) for Core's own verbs — `up`,
  `extract` (archive files only), `mkcd`, `mkbak`, `maint-log`, `openv` — fpath-added
  by `options.zsh` (symlink-safe; no bootstrap symlink needed). The audit now `zsh -n`s
  them alongside `zsh/*.zsh`.
- `scripts/lib/common.sh` — one definition of the colour palette + `pass`/`skip`/`fail`/
  `hdr`/`have` shared by all five gate scripts (the block had been copy-pasted ×5). A
  sourced lib, so — like `zsh/*.zsh` — it stays mode 100644; the audit's exec-bit
  section gained a `scripts/lib/*.sh` arm to assert exactly that.
- `scripts/tool-versions.env` — single source for the pinned dev-tool versions, read by
  CI (loaded into `$GITHUB_ENV`), `make setup`, and the audit. `scripts/setup.sh` +
  `make setup`: a one-command dev bootstrap (pre-commit hooks + version doctor + audit).
- `actionlint` gate on the workflows: an audit section (graceful skip when absent) plus
  a pinned CI install — the workflow YAML is now validated, not just parsed.
- Audit version-consistency section: the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` hook revs are gated
  to equal `scripts/tool-versions.env`, so a one-sided pin bump fails the audit.
- Hermetic behavioral tests for `bin/clip` / `bin/clip-paste` (the highest-fan-out
  runtime artifact — used by zsh, tmux, and nvim): a new section in
  `scripts/test-core.sh` drives the WSL→macOS→Wayland→X11 detection ladder against a
  fake `PATH`, asserting the right backend is chosen. Runs even where zsh is absent.
- Headless Neovim config-load smoke test in `scripts/test-core.sh`: loads the authored
  config layer and every plugin spec offline (no install), catching luacheck-clean Lua
  that is nonetheless a broken config. CI ships a pinned `nvim` (`NVIM_VERSION`) so it
  runs on both userlands instead of skipping.
- Alpine (musl/busybox) CI leg, run via a bind-mounted container, finally exercising
  the busybox-coreutils compatibility the scripts have always claimed.
- `scripts/update-plugins.sh` + `make update-plugins`: deliberately roll the pinned
  zsh-plugin SHAs to upstream HEAD — the runtime-plugin mirror of `make update-hooks`.
- Markdown lint gate: `.markdownlint.jsonc` rule config, a `markdownlint` section in
  `scripts/audit-core.sh` (graceful skip when absent), a `markdownlint-cli2` pre-commit
  hook, and a pinned CI install step — so the docs (the deliverable on a public
  showcase repo) are gated like everything else.
- `scripts/bench-core.sh` gained an optional `CORE_BENCH_BUDGET_MS` budget gate (fails
  when the canonical-chain startup mean exceeds the budget), plus a non-blocking CI
  `bench` job that reports the number on every push.
- `SECURITY.md` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug + feature + config) round out the
  GitHub community profile; `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents a Conventional Commits
  convention.
- Broader behavioral coverage in `scripts/test-core.sh`: `mkbak` byte-identity,
  `extract` unknown-format rejection, and `extract` round-trips for `.tar.gz`/`.gz`
  (the latter skip gracefully when `tar`/`gzip` are absent).
- CI runs the audit on a `[ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]` matrix, gating the macOS
  (bash 3.2 / BSD userland) target — `dotfiles-MacBook` — alongside Linux.
- `scripts/audit-core.sh` and the pre-commit config parse-check every tracked TOML and
  YAML file, catching malformed `starship.toml` / `mise/config.toml` / workflow
  YAML that is valid text but dead at runtime for every consumer.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `scripts/sync-core.sh` reports the exact dotfiles-core revision (short SHA) each OS
  repo receives, so a sync is traceable.
- `scripts/bench-core.sh` + `make bench`: a hermetic hyperfine benchmark of the
  canonical Core load chain, so startup-perf regressions (the thing tools.zsh's
  caching and plugins.zsh's deferral exist to prevent) are measurable, not silent.

### Changed

- `scripts/setup.sh` provisions `luacheck` via `luarocks` (no clean mise source) and
  emits precise, actionable install hints — closing the last manual onboarding gap.
- Defensive confirms on impactful interactive actions: `please` now previews the exact
  `sudo …` line and confirms before eval'ing it as root (and refuses with no previous
  command); `up` pre-confirms `Apply updates with <mgr>?` before touching the system
  (skipped by `-y`); `serve` warns plainly that it binds `0.0.0.0` and exposes the CWD.
- First-run plugin install shows a spinner on the network-bound `git fetch`/`clone`
  (gum spin when present, a hand-rolled braille spinner otherwise), guarded so an OS
  loader that hasn't adopted `ui.zsh` yet still installs plainly.
- CI is now incremental: a `changes` job classifies the diff and gates the narrow,
  expensive legs — `nvim`+`luacheck` installs run only when `nvim/` changed, and the
  Alpine and bench jobs only when the shell layer changed. SAFE DEFAULT: an unresolved
  diff base or any infra change runs everything, so detection can never hide a check.
- The startup-perf `bench` CI job is now an enforced regression gate
  (`CORE_BENCH_BUDGET_MS=120` over 50 warmed runs), not a report-only, continue-on-error
  step — a gross startup regression now fails the build instead of shipping silently.
- The pinned linter versions moved out of `ci.yml`'s `env:` block into
  `scripts/tool-versions.env`; CI loads them via a "Load pinned tool versions" step.
- Split `bin/` into shipped vs. tooling: `bin/` now holds only what is vendored into
  the OS repos (`clip`, `clip-paste`); the gate scripts moved to `scripts/`
  (`audit-core.sh`, `test-core.sh`, `bench-core.sh`, `sync-core.sh`,
  `update-plugins.sh`). The audit allowlists `scripts/` wholesale, so a new dev tool
  is covered the moment it lands. No consumer impact — those scripts were never in
  the manifest, so they were never vendored.
- `scripts/audit-core.sh` no longer uses the bash-4-only `mapfile`, so the gate itself
  runs on macOS's stock bash 3.2.

### Security

- Pinned the seven runtime zsh plugins to commit SHAs (`ZPLUGIN_PINS` in
  `zsh/plugins.zsh`) — the last unpinned link in a toolchain that already pins CI
  linters, pre-commit hooks, and GitHub Actions. An unpinned `master` clone fanned an
  upstream breaking change — or a compromised tag — out to all nine machines on the
  next install; installs now fetch exactly the pinned commit.

### Fixed

- fzf / fzf-tab previews hardcoded `bat`/`eza`, so every preview pane printed
  "command not found" on Debian/Ubuntu (bat ships as `batcat`) and on any box without
  eza. Previews now resolve `$BAT_BIN` with a `cat`/`ls` fallback, and a new audit
  section (`fzf preview binary resolution`) locks it so the regression can't recur.
- `fif`, `fbr`, and the Alt-Z zoxide-jump widget assumed `fzf`/`rg`/`git`/`zoxide`
  were present; they now degrade in Core's voice (`_core_err`/`_core_hint`) like `fcd`,
  instead of a raw "command not found".
- Removed leaked `</content>`/`</invoke>` template artifacts from the end of this
  changelog — the exact bug class the new markdown gate now catches.
- Restored non-executable mode (`100644`) on the twelve `zsh/*.zsh` modules. They
  are sourced, not executed, and had regressed to `100755`, failing the audit's
  exec-bit invariant — the exact bug class the audit exists to catch, fanning out
  to all nine OS repos.
- Registered `CODEOWNERS`, `dependabot.yml`, and `pull_request_template.md` in the
  audit's `META_ALLOWLIST` so the manifest reverse-drift scan accounts for them.
