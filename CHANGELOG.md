# Changelog

All notable changes to **dotfiles-core** are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

Core is the single source of truth vendored into nine OS repos via
`git subtree pull --prefix=core <core-remote> main --squash` (see `scripts/sync-core.sh`).
Every entry below is therefore a change those repos receive on their next sync —
this file is the human-readable record of _what_ a sync will bring, complementing
the SHA that `scripts/sync-core.sh` now prints. To cut a release, move the
`[Unreleased]` items under a new `## [vX.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` heading and tag the
commit (`git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m vX.Y.Z`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Hermetic behavioral tests for `bin/clip` / `bin/clip-paste` (the highest-fan-out
  runtime artifact — used by zsh, tmux, and nvim): a new section in
  `scripts/test-core.sh` drives the WSL→macOS→Wayland→X11 detection ladder against a
  fake `PATH`, asserting the right backend is chosen. Runs even where zsh is absent.
- Headless Neovim config-load smoke test in `scripts/test-core.sh`: loads the authored
  config layer and every plugin spec offline (no install), catching luacheck-clean Lua
  that is nonetheless a broken config. CI ships a pinned `nvim` (`NVIM_VERSION`) so it
  runs on both userlands instead of skipping.
- Alpine (musl/busybox) CI leg, run via a bind-mounted container, finally exercising
  the busybox-coreutils compatibility the scripts have always claimed.
- `scripts/update-plugins.sh` + `make update-plugins`: deliberately roll the pinned
  zsh-plugin SHAs to upstream HEAD — the runtime-plugin mirror of `make update-hooks`.
- Markdown lint gate: `.markdownlint.jsonc` rule config, a `markdownlint` section in
  `scripts/audit-core.sh` (graceful skip when absent), a `markdownlint-cli2` pre-commit
  hook, and a pinned CI install step — so the docs (the deliverable on a public
  showcase repo) are gated like everything else.
- `scripts/bench-core.sh` gained an optional `CORE_BENCH_BUDGET_MS` budget gate (fails
  when the canonical-chain startup mean exceeds the budget), plus a non-blocking CI
  `bench` job that reports the number on every push.
- `SECURITY.md` and `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug + feature + config) round out the
  GitHub community profile; `CONTRIBUTING.md` documents a Conventional Commits
  convention.
- Broader behavioral coverage in `scripts/test-core.sh`: `mkbak` byte-identity,
  `extract` unknown-format rejection, and `extract` round-trips for `.tar.gz`/`.gz`
  (the latter skip gracefully when `tar`/`gzip` are absent).
- CI runs the audit on a `[ubuntu-latest, macos-latest]` matrix, gating the macOS
  (bash 3.2 / BSD userland) target — `dotfiles-MacBook` — alongside Linux.
- `scripts/audit-core.sh` and the pre-commit config parse-check every tracked TOML and
  YAML file, catching malformed `starship.toml` / `mise/config.toml` / workflow
  YAML that is valid text but dead at runtime for every consumer.
- This `CHANGELOG.md`.
- `scripts/sync-core.sh` reports the exact dotfiles-core revision (short SHA) each OS
  repo receives, so a sync is traceable.
- `scripts/bench-core.sh` + `make bench`: a hermetic hyperfine benchmark of the
  canonical Core load chain, so startup-perf regressions (the thing tools.zsh's
  caching and plugins.zsh's deferral exist to prevent) are measurable, not silent.

### Changed

- Split `bin/` into shipped vs. tooling: `bin/` now holds only what is vendored into
  the OS repos (`clip`, `clip-paste`); the gate scripts moved to `scripts/`
  (`audit-core.sh`, `test-core.sh`, `bench-core.sh`, `sync-core.sh`,
  `update-plugins.sh`). The audit allowlists `scripts/` wholesale, so a new dev tool
  is covered the moment it lands. No consumer impact — those scripts were never in
  the manifest, so they were never vendored.
- `scripts/audit-core.sh` no longer uses the bash-4-only `mapfile`, so the gate itself
  runs on macOS's stock bash 3.2.

### Security

- Pinned the seven runtime zsh plugins to commit SHAs (`ZPLUGIN_PINS` in
  `zsh/plugins.zsh`) — the last unpinned link in a toolchain that already pins CI
  linters, pre-commit hooks, and GitHub Actions. An unpinned `master` clone fanned an
  upstream breaking change — or a compromised tag — out to all nine machines on the
  next install; installs now fetch exactly the pinned commit.

  ### Fixed

- Removed leaked `</content>`/`</invoke>` template artifacts from the end of this
  changelog — the exact bug class the new markdown gate now catches.
- Restored non-executable mode (`100644`) on the twelve `zsh/*.zsh` modules. They
  are sourced, not executed, and had regressed to `100755`, failing the audit's
  exec-bit invariant — the exact bug class the audit exists to catch, fanning out
  to all nine OS repos.
- Registered `CODEOWNERS`, `dependabot.yml`, and `pull_request_template.md` in the
  audit's `META_ALLOWLIST` so the manifest reverse-drift scan accounts for them.
