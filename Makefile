# Makefile — single source of truth for lint/format. Humans and CI run the SAME
# commands, so "passes locally" means "passes in CI".
#
# Scope: only repo-owned files. `core/` is a vendored git-subtree from
# dotfiles-core and is linted in THAT repo's CI — reformatting it here would
# fight the subtree. A non-blocking `core-advisory` target surfaces core/ findings
# without gating. See README "Development".
#
# Quick start:  make lint   (run everything)   |   make fmt   (auto-format)

# Repo-owned bash scripts: every *.sh outside the vendored core/ subtree, plus
# sketchybar/sketchybarrc — a bash entry point with NO .sh extension (sketchybar
# requires that exact filename), so the glob would miss it. Append it explicitly
# so shellcheck/shfmt/syntax cover it like any other repo-owned script.

# Repo-owned zsh modules. These are the real behavioral surface of this repo, yet
# the .sh-only globs above never reach them (the entry files have NO extension).
# `zsh -n` parses each so a broken edit can't ship green. core/ zsh is gated in
# dotfiles-core's own CI.
